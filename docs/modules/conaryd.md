summary: Document conaryd authorization, typed apply refusals, exact-generation package jobs, routes, and daemon boundaries
---

# conaryd

`conaryd` is the local daemon for query routes, package job queueing, and SSE
events. It listens on the configured local socket and applies the same
apply-intent boundary as the CLI for package mutation jobs. Unimplemented
system-operation routes are absent rather than exposed as placeholders.

## Authorization

`GET /health` is outside the v1 auth gate so service managers can perform basic
liveness checks. `/v1/*` routes are behind the v1 gate. Query routes are
read-oriented. Package mutation and system operation routes require the daemon
authorization checks and still require explicit apply intent in request bodies
where the operation can mutate the host. Package requests send
`apply_intent: true`; removed acknowledgement aliases are rejected as unknown
request fields.

Root, the daemon identity, and members of the exact group passed through
`--socket-group` can perform daemon operations. At startup, conaryd resolves
that group once and fails if it does not exist; the same group owns the
mode-`0660` Unix socket and is checked against `SO_PEERCRED` plus the live
process supplementary-group list. With no configured group, the API is
root/daemon-only. There is no PolicyKit placeholder, broad authenticated-user
fallback, or implicit `sudo`/`wheel` distribution-group selection.

## Package Job Execution Boundary

Daemon install, remove, and update jobs are queued and tracked by `conaryd`, but
the package operation executor in `apps/conaryd/src/daemon/package_ops.rs`
currently calls the CLI command functions from the `conary` crate
(`cmd_install`, `cmd_remove`, and `cmd_update`). Changes to package-job behavior
therefore need both daemon-route/job proof and the owning CLI package-command
proof; `package_ops.rs` is the adapter boundary, not an independent package
manager implementation.

Apply-intent refusals retain `conary::live_host_safety::LiveMutationRefusal`,
including the exact command label and mutation class. Its plain display uses
the same diagnostic facts and guidance as the CLI without terminal escapes,
so direct package-job callers and persisted error messages retain the safe
preview/confirmation routes. This does not change job error schemas or the
apply-intent predicate.

A mutating package operation is complete only when its exact selected-root
generation is published. If the package database commit succeeds but generation
publication leaves recoverable debt, the daemon reports the job as failed with
the persisted publication phase, failure detail, and exact retry command. It
must not label a database-only mutation as a completed package job. Package
publication never mutates the ambient root passed to the daemon; the new
generation is the execution result.

Route implementation ownership: `apps/conaryd/src/daemon/routes.rs` is the
route hub; `daemon/config.rs` owns runtime configuration and canonical defaults;
`routes/router.rs` owns Axum assembly; `routes/types.rs` owns API DTOs;
`routes/errors.rs` owns API error conversion; `routes/auth.rs` owns route-level
auth and job/event visibility gates; `routes/db.rs` owns blocking DB query
plumbing; `routes/sse.rs` owns SSE connection guarding; and
`routes/{system,query,transactions,events}.rs` own endpoint declarations and
handlers.
