# Infrastructure Overview

## Host Roles

- Remi is the production package service behind `https://remi.conary.io`.
- Direct SSH access for the Remi host uses `ssh.conary.io`, not the proxied
  public HTTPS hostnames.
- Remi runs Ubuntu 26.04 LTS on the Hetzner origin. The host OS is independent
  of the public client distro support matrix, which is Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04
  LTS, and Arch Linux for the limited preview. The destructive host procedure,
  storage contract, recovery boundary, and completion proof live in
  [the Remi host rebuild runbook](remi-host-rebuild.md).
- Forge remote validation and Forge-local staging deployment are decommissioned.
  The old VPS runner did not expose `/dev/kvm`, and no replacement Forge host
  or conary-test deployment path is supported.
- Hosted CI keeps Remi health/audit/build/list checks active. QEMU release
  evidence comes from `scripts/local-qemu-validation.sh` on a local
  development machine with `/dev/kvm`.
- Sensitive usernames, credentials, or workstation-only shortcuts belong in the
  ignored `docs/operations/LOCAL_ACCESS.md`, <!-- repo-path: local --> not in tracked docs.

## Agent Operations And MCP

Remi's `/mcp` is the live MCP surface and is modern-only stateless Streamable
HTTP. `conary-test` is a local CLI and integration-test engine; it no longer
binds an HTTP or MCP listener. The framework-neutral compliance and raw-adapter
proof remains in `crates/conary-mcp`, while Remi owns live MCP behavior.

Prefer MCP resources for read-only state inspection and MCP tools for audited
mutations. MCP is the adapter, not the durable product contract:

The first LLM-native operations milestone may define prompt catalogs in
`conary-agent-contract`, but it must not register new live MCP prompts until
the stateless MCP adapter decision is satisfied.
The transport-neutral contract lives in `crates/conary-agent-contract`;
`crates/conary-mcp` remains MCP-specific adapter glue.

- Remi admin and package-service operations
- `conary-test` local run control, deploy/restart flows, image management, and fixture publishing

### Local Packaging MCP

`conary mcp packaging` starts the local stdio MCP server for packaging agent
workflows. It does not open a network listener. Its read-only
`conary.packaging.verify_artifact` tool requires an explicit package and trust
policy path, calls the shared CCS verifier, and returns the same versioned
structured report as `ccs verify --json`. See the
[CCS verification report contract](../specs/ccs-verification-report-v1.md). The first mutation contract is
confirmed static artifact publish through `conary.packaging.publish.plan` and
`conary.packaging.publish.apply`; Remi publish apply and project-form publish
apply are intentionally unsupported in this slice.

Use manual SSH, rsync, or curl only when the structured operation surface does
not cover the task or when you are debugging the underlying service path itself.

## Safe Public And Admin Endpoints

- Public package web UI and authenticated MCP endpoint:
  `https://remi.conary.io`
- Direct SSH hostname for the Remi origin host: `ssh.conary.io`
- Remi admin origin API: `http://localhost:8082` via SSH tunnel or direct
  origin access
- Remi OpenAPI spec: `http://localhost:8082/v1/admin/openapi.json` via SSH
  tunnel or direct origin access
- `conary-test` has no network endpoint. Use its local `health` and `deploy
  status` CLI commands for local/Remi checks.

## Source Deploy Patterns

### Forge

Forge staging, conary-test deployment, and the managed rollout path are
decommissioned. No Forge host, remote test-service deployment, or rollout
command is supported. Use the local QEMU/KVM validation gate and hosted Remi
checks for current evidence; historical Forge artifacts are not an active host
workflow.

### Remi

- Use the direct origin hostname `ssh.conary.io` for SSH and rsync.
- Use the normal admin account (`<admin>@ssh.conary.io`) recorded in the ignored
  `docs/operations/LOCAL_ACCESS.md`, <!-- repo-path: local --> plus passwordless,
  least-privilege `sudo`;
  root SSH login is not part of the supported deploy path.
- Exclude `target/`, `.git/`, and `.worktrees/`
- The durable deploy entry point is the root-owned helper installed at
  `/usr/local/sbin/conary-remi-deploy`, with the sudo policy tracked in
  `deploy/sudoers/remi`. The helper owns privileged actions for publishing
  Conary release artifacts and performing recoverable Remi service transitions.
- Normal Remi binary replacement is driven by GitHub Actions
  `release-build` -> `deploy-and-verify`. The workflow stages the built bundle
  and tag-bound repository manifest on the host, atomically self-updates the
  helper by SHA-256, then calls
  `/usr/local/sbin/conary-remi-deploy deploy-remi`.
- A bounded pre-release hard-cut sequence that explicitly forbids an
  intermediate release uses `deploy-remi-candidate` instead. Its required
  full commit SHA must already be an ancestor of `origin/main`; the protected
  production environment builds that tree, records the binary digest,
  and uses the same recoverable helper and source manifest. Dispatch must choose
  either `private-candidates` or `active-repopulation` completion. It creates no
  tag or release and is not a path for deploying an unmerged pull-request head.
- Every protected workflow that can mutate the shared production host, stop or
  probe Remi, pin its catalogs, or inspect/mutate its R2 authority uses the same
  non-cancelling `deploy-and-verify` concurrency group: `deploy-and-verify`,
  `deploy-remi-candidate`, `deploy-site`,
  `export-remi-native-oracle-inputs`, `survey-remi-resolution`,
  `remi-conversion-benchmark`, and `remi-r2-durability`. A stopped-service
  survey or benchmark therefore cannot overlap a deploy, frontend probe,
  native-oracle export, or durability operation.
- Candidate deployment uses one fail-closed SSH option contract for every
  remote command and transfer: authentication is noninteractive, initial
  connection time is bounded, and protocol keepalives cover long refresh and
  inspection phases. A dead transport therefore fails within a bounded window;
  an otherwise healthy long-running remote phase remains attached to its
  protected runner and can return typed terminal evidence.
- Candidate deployment retains exactly one final typed inspection instead of
  emitting every incomplete poll. Private-candidate mode also retains the
  pre-transition inspection used as its fencing baseline. The workflow runs
  that versioned read-only command from the staged binary after checking
  its SHA-256, so a new baseline schema does not depend on the previously
  installed binary. The baseline reads current schema, configured repository,
  candidate-pointer, exact run-member, and latest-refresh rows only. It does
  not open signing material, immutable catalogs, package rows, conversions, or
  universe state. Its two-second budget and zero catalog opens/bytes are
  fail-closed workflow predicates, and its output records wall/CPU/RSS, SQLite
  statement and logical page-read work, and serialized bytes.
- A baseline may contain an absent candidate only as a null identity plus the
  exact latest fenced refresh diagnosis. This is evidence of what the new
  binary must recover, not candidate completion; half-present identities,
  changed candidate source membership, and missing or duplicate public
  profiles fail before mutation. Each canonical
  public profile includes its current candidate plus the exact latest fenced
  refresh run, typed state and failure stage/category, member progress,
  raw-evidence SHA-256, and a bounded redacted diagnostic copy. The protected
  job materializes its postdeployment fencing predicate from the exact
  `github.workflow_sha` whose workflow definition is executing, not from the
  deliberately older candidate checkout. It requires that workflow authority
  to be merged into `origin/main`. The job binds the final inspection to the
  merged candidate commit, built binary
  SHA-256, completion mode, and post-transition timestamp, uploads those
  public-sanitized JSON artifacts, and writes a concise typed summary even when
  completion fails. It does not expose service logs, generic shell access,
  credentials, bearer tokens, private-key paths, or host-local paths, and
  diagnostics do not satisfy the candidate publication predicate.
- Candidate deployment evidence schema 3 records each remote phase and its wall time:
  database transition/restart, ingress verification, all-profile refresh,
  each exact-profile retry, completion inspection, and final ingress proof.
  It also retains every accepted repository-refresh generation with exact
  scope, producer force policy, start/finish time, coalescing disposition,
  aggregate state, and successful/failed profile sets. Candidate completion is
  bounded by one of those generations rather than inferred from elapsed
  workflow time.
  Inspection JSON is accepted only from stdout and structurally validated
  before final ingress; stderr diagnostics are never spliced into the typed
  evidence. Private-candidate completion passes the exact deployment-transition
  timestamp as a causal floor. Because candidate completion is ordered after
  complete catalog proof and an independent durable-destination reopen, that
  mode rechecks the exact registered candidate, manifest, bundle shape, file
  size, fenced run members, and repository bindings without rehashing or
  integrity-scanning the same multi-gigabyte catalogs again. Its typed evidence
  must report `publication_attested`, the exact transition floor, and zero
  catalog reopen/hash/integrity work. Active-repopulation and ordinary manual
  inspections retain the full reopen path. A failed completion predicate reuses
  its already captured typed inspection, while an early remote, invalid-output,
  or transport failure produces a sanitized failure envelope and attempts one
  read-only final inspection only when no typed capture exists. Neither path
  turns missing diagnostics into a successful deployment. Before and after the
  remote attempt, `inspect-remi-storage` records only numeric filesystem,
  SQLite, and transition-backup counts plus logical/allocated byte totals. It
  rejects symlinked or structurally unexpected backup storage and exposes no
  host path.
- The candidate Remi binary owns config/schema preparation. It type-checks the
  current config and source manifest, installs exact parser authority,
  retains a current-schema SQLite database in place or moves a retired epoch
  plus WAL/SHM into `/conary/deployment-backups/`, and emits the transition
  manifest used for automatic rollback. Schema revision is the persisted-data
  compatibility boundary: a same-revision binary rollback restores config and
  repository authority while retaining the compatible live database, so an
  ordinary deploy performs zero complete database copies. Retired schemas are
  not migrated in place and retain their recoverable files. The helper
  stops Remi before preparation,
  and the candidate independently enforces that quiescence: prepare acquires
  the same kernel-backed canonical runtime-root lock as the server before its
  first mutation. Transition-manifest schema 3 records that exact canonical
  root, and rollback reacquires it before restoring config, repository
  authority, or SQLite state. Live ownership fails immediately; service names,
  PIDs, lock-file contents, timestamps, and stale-file cleanup are not recovery
  authority. `deployment inspect` is read-only evidence and does not establish
  quiescence. Before invoking the root-run candidate, the helper creates the
  lock file as `conary:conary` mode 0600, or verifies an existing plain file has
  that access contract, so first deployment cannot strand a root-owned
  lock that the `User=conary` service cannot open.
- The helper creates `/conary/repository-keys` as a `conary:conary` mode-0700
  durable authority root before candidate preparation. The candidate
  atomically creates one complete targets/snapshot/timestamp key set under
  each exact manifest profile. Repeat deployments preserve those bytes.
  Existing wrong ownership or modes, partial or mismatched role pairs,
  symlinks, unexpected entries, and route-slug aliases fail before service
  activation. This directory is deliberately outside release rollback and
  deletion paths.
- After liveness succeeds, the deployment job proves the predicate selected by
  its explicit completion mode. `private-candidates` records every public
  profile's pre-transition fencing epoch, invokes the loopback-only forced
  refresh endpoint after the new binary starts with the exact transition
  completion timestamp as its causal floor, requires a typed successful
  refresh generation, then calls `conary-remi-deploy inspect-remi
  --require-private-candidates` once. Success means every configured public
  profile has an exact current, durable, nonempty private candidate whose
  immutable bundle and fenced repository bindings were reopened and
  revalidated. A same-schema deployment requires every Fedora, Ubuntu, and
  Arch fencing epoch to be strictly newer than its recorded baseline. A hard
  schema transition starts a new fence, so its positive fresh
  epochs are not ordered against the retired database. Both paths require each
  accepted terminal candidate run to match its candidate, finish after the
  recorded binary transition, and fall within a refresh generation that
  names that profile as successful. If the new process's startup all-profile
  refresh finishes after the floor with a complete zero-skip batch, the queued
  forced request consumes that retained result and performs no second source
  refresh. Pre-floor, scoped, partial, failed, cancelled, or skipped work is
  never eligible; intervening repository mutations invalidate the retained
  result, and a force call without a floor always executes. Candidate-tier Solus
  is incidental to the all-repository refresh: its success cannot satisfy and
  its typed failure cannot block that public-profile completion contract.
  Private-candidate completion proves no active pointer and accepts structured
  public readiness as either ready or intentionally unavailable.
  `active-repopulation` polls
  `inspect-remi --require-repopulated` and requires all configured public
  profiles to have populated active immutable catalogs, a complete signing role
  set, a fresh signed universe naming the same profile revisions, and at
  least one validated converted artifact pinned to every current revision.
  Mutable `repository_packages` rows are not evidence for either mode;
  dispatch, a preexisting candidate, or a green liveness probe alone is not
  deployment proof.
- Production native-oracle inputs use the root-owned helper operation
  `export-native-oracle-inputs <export-id> <fedora-sha256> <ubuntu-sha256>
  <arch-sha256>`. The helper fixes canonical public-profile order, invokes the
  typed `remi native-oracle-input` command as the service user, retains the
  durable independently reopened directory below
  `/conary/evidence/native-oracle-inputs/`, and stages a mode-0600 transport tar
  under `/tmp` for the authenticated caller. The typed command copies only
  exact metadata bytes retained in the immutable source bundles and performs no
  upstream network request or URL reconstruction. It grants no generic path,
  candidate-tier profile, native comparison, conversion, proof, activation, or
  pointer-mutation authority.
- The protected `export-remi-native-oracle-inputs` workflow is the production
  caller and artifact handoff. Its only input is a successful
  `deploy-remi-candidate` run in `private-candidates` mode. It reopens that
  run's sanitized inspection, requires the exact ordered Fedora, Ubuntu, and
  Arch revisions, and shares the non-cancelling `deploy-and-verify` concurrency
  group with release and candidate deployments. A deployment-triggered
  candidate replacement cannot race the multi-profile pin/export window. The
  typed operator also inserts reader pins for the complete three-profile set in
  one operational transaction before it reopens any catalog bytes, so a slow
  earlier reopen cannot expose a later selected resource to concurrent GC. The
  workflow invokes the fixed helper operation through a production SSH boundary
  authenticated by the protected `REMI_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` pin; live host-key
  discovery is forbidden. Its workflow commit must equal freshly fetched
  protected `main` both at authorization and immediately before SSH; an old
  run cannot be rerun to mint fresh export authority after `main` advances.
  It removes only the staged `/tmp` transport after
  download and records a typed operator attestation bound to the export run's
  exact protected workflow commit.
  The runner independently rejects unsafe tar members, noncanonical or
  duplicate-key JSON, revision/source digest drift, incomplete object
  inventories, and wrong-sized or digest-mismatched metadata. The seven-day
  handoff artifact contains the exact uncompressed transport, its canonical
  public-sanitized verification record, operator attestation, and source
  deployment inspection; it grants no native-oracle production, conversion,
  proof, or activation authority.
- The required `producer_commit` input to `produce-remi-native-oracles` is one
  full lowercase 40-hex SHA. Pass the deployed commit by default; name a newer
  producer only deliberately. Authorization fetches `origin/main`, requires
  deployed-to-producer-to-main ancestry, and each lane requires that exact
  clean checkout before building and recording both producer binary digests.
- The optional `lanes` input to `produce-remi-native-oracles` defaults to
  `fedora-44,ubuntu-26.04,arch` and accepts only a non-empty duplicate-free
  subset of those comma-separated names. Selected lanes run in this
  dispatch; assembly retrieves an unselected lane only from the newest
  successful same-export strict artifact, verifies the GitHub archive digest,
  and still requires one bound artifact for every canonical lane.
- The protected `produce-remi-native-oracles` workflow consumes only one
  successful export run. Its production-environment authorization
  independently reopens the exported transport and schema-3 deployment
  inspection, requires canonical Fedora, Ubuntu, and Arch candidate order, and
  requires the artifact-owned deployed commit to remain merged into `main`.
  It also requires the export's canonical operator attestation to bind its
  exact run commit and attempt to the protected pinned-host-key SSH contract;
  that export commit must equal the producer's exact current protected-main
  workflow commit. Pre-attestation and stale-operator exports cannot become
  strict oracle authority.
  Each lane checks out that exact clean producer source, never a workflow head,
  then runs in the release-pinned Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04, or
  Arch image with libsolv 0.7.36, apt-pkg 3.2.0, or the archived libalpm state.
  `produce-native-oracle-lane.py` revalidates canonical input JSON, profile and
  source digests, exact typed metadata roles, complete object inventory, size,
  and SHA-256 before deriving producer arguments. It invokes the matching
  package-fact producer once, runs and uploads the diagnostics-only resolution
  survey, and then runs the exact-architecture strict resolution producer;
  all completed outputs are independently reopened. A strict failure still
  fails the lane after the survey upload and emits no strict artifact.
  Seven-day lane artifacts contain only the two canonical oracle bundles and
  public-sanitized evidence binding their manifests, artifacts, counts,
  implementation versions, candidate revision, export identity,
  deployed/producer commits, and SHA-256 digests of both producer binaries.
  The workflow has read-only GitHub permissions and no refresh,
  conversion, proof, activation, SSH, or pointer-mutation authority.
  Final assembly accepts only strict lane artifacts from the same export and
  common deployed commit. Different per-lane producer commits are allowed only
  when each is a merged descendant and all schema/implementation pins match;
  missing lanes, digest drift, and survey substitution fail closed.
- The protected `survey-remi-resolution` workflow consumes one successful
  `produce-remi-native-oracles` run and resolves its export and deployment
  runs from its canonical assembled three-lane evidence. The oracle run head
  must equal the survey's own exact current protected-main operator commit, so
  a historical producer rerun is not admissible. It independently
  authenticates the assembled artifact archive and every referenced strict lane
  archive, including a retained same-export lane from an earlier successful
  producer run, before reopening every package and resolution oracle. Their
  deployment commit, producer ancestry and binary digests, candidate revision,
  export manifest, and typed architecture bindings must agree. The workflow
  rejects export runs without the exact pinned-SSH operator
  attestation before it invokes the root-owned survey action
  `survey-resolution <survey-id> <export-id> <oracle-transport-path>`. The
  production environment supplies an exact `REMI_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` pin; live
  host-key discovery is forbidden and the selected host must match the pin. The
  workflow checks out `github.workflow_sha`, requires that revision's helper
  bytes to equal the helper at its freshly fetched protected `origin/main`, and
  requires the complete workflow revision itself to equal that current main
  commit. After staging the bytes it repeats the main fetch, exact-commit check,
  and digest equality immediately before the root `install-helper` action. That
  action independently resolves current protected main through GitHub's HTTPS
  API, downloads the exact commit's helper from the protected repository, and
  installs only those root-fetched bytes after matching the requested digest.
  The SSH caller's staged file is comparison input, never installation authority.
  Historical reruns and any concurrent main advance therefore fail before host
  mutation instead of using stale workflow, verifier, or helper authority. The
  workflow then calls the new action. The
  helper arms cleanup as soon as private root-owned staging exists,
  authenticates every archive member there,
  stops Remi, reads the exact candidate revisions from the stopped deployment's
  own candidate pointers, runs `remi resolution-survey` as `conary`, freezes its
  output while Remi remains stopped, and retains that root-owned snapshot at
  `/conary/evidence/.remi-operator-staging/completed-resolution-survey-<survey-id>/survey-output`.
  <!-- repo-path: hypothetical -->
  It then attempts service restoration using the deploy helper's `/health`
  endpoint (listener startup; publication readiness remains `/health/ready`).
  Deploy and survey probes measure monotonic restart-to-ready seconds, including
  `systemctl start`, and persist a sanitized schema-1 inspection at
  `/var/lib/conary-remi-deploy/readiness.json`. <!-- repo-path: external -->
  `inspect-remi` includes it as `restart_readiness`. The budget is twice the last
  successful recorded duration (with a one-second measurement floor), capped at
  7,200 seconds including service start and probes. Until a current measurement
  exists, the basis is the 3,540-second catalog reopen/completion evidence in
  #913 (deploy run 33933238628), giving 7,080 seconds. Obsolete or malformed
  measurements are non-authority and rebuilt using that evidence; failed probes
  retain the last successful duration and record elapsed time with a null
  restart-to-ready duration.
  A completed survey publishes its unchanged sanitized transport even when
  restoration reports `restore_failed`. The separately digest-bound schema-1
  `resolution-survey-restore.json` binds survey/export identities, the exact
  transport digest/size, typed retained location, and restore timing/outcome.
  The host retains `manifest.json`, sanitized `outcome.json`, the authenticated
  `input-manifest.json`, and `restore.json` alongside `survey-output`;
  operators resolve `completed_resolution_survey/<survey-id>` to the directory
  above. Retained snapshots require explicit operator removal after retrieval.
  The workflow checks helper status against the typed outcome, independently
  reopens the same survey transport, uploads evidence and counts, and only then
  fails on restoration. Restore failure diagnostics include systemctl status or
  readiness timeout, elapsed/budget seconds, and the last 30 Remi journal lines.
  Cleanup never retries an exhausted restore budget.
  `RemiResolutionSurveyOutcome` and its nested Rust types own the outcome shape.
  The Rust serialization test writes clean, mixed, and failed three-profile
  fixtures, checks their committed snapshots, and invokes the shell suite against
  those generated bytes. The shell suite applies the helper's exact named-clause
  predicate and rejects missing/extra fields, non-integer counts, invalid null
  branches, and inconsistent aggregates. Regenerate the snapshots only through
  `CONARY_REMI_UPDATE_OUTCOME_FIXTURES=1 cargo test -p remi resolution_survey_outcome_serialization_contract`.
  A rejected outcome reports its failing clause, command exit status, and
  sanitized JSON. Empty stdout is `outcome.document_count` with
  `document_state: empty`; malformed JSON is retained as a digest/size-bound
  diagnostic marker. Neither case implies that a survey outcome was serialized.
  Remi's top-level status `101` is a successful operator result only when the
  typed outcome records findings.
  On any helper failure, including an absent or malformed report line, the
  workflow attempts the fixed
  `conary-remi-deploy export-resolution-survey-evidence <survey-id> <export-id> <input-manifest-sha256>`
  action before removing SSH credentials. The third argument is the authenticated
  input transport's manifest digest, recorded as `manifest_sha256` in
  `resolution-survey-input-verification.json`. It binds the retained
  `input-manifest.json` bytes to that authenticated input before the shared
  schema-2 validator runs; a digest mismatch rejects recovery. Obtain the digest
  from that verification record, never from the retained file being checked.
  The workflow uploads a typed `helper_failed` record with status and sanitized
  message plus the recovered
  output, outcome, and restore documents. The schema-1 recovery manifest binds
  each allowlisted file by digest/size and, when retained, the exact authenticated
  input manifest. `verify-recovery` checks those bindings and privacy before
  exposing the diagnostic files to upload. Missing retained evidence and failed
  retrieval are explicit states. Recovery has `diagnostic_only` authority and
  never substitutes for normal `verify-output` validation or its oracle,
  deployment, implementation, and comparison bindings. The returned
  seven-day artifact contains only
  canonical survey JSON, a digest/size/binding manifest, and public verification
  records, including the authenticated three-lane assembly. Raw deployment
  inspection is destroyed during helper cleanup. Survey stderr is retained as
  mode-`0600` `diagnostic.log`, together with the original `outcome.raw.json`,
  for host-local investigation. Both are excluded from recovery exports and
  workflow logs; restore failures additionally expose the
  requested journal tail. Neither helper
  input admission nor runner output verification places an invented aggregate
  ceiling on survey transport that the producer contract does not establish;
  the uncompressed input archive uses GNU base-256 tar headers, avoiding an
  unsupported 8-GiB ceiling on any authenticated catalog member without PAX
  metadata. Each member is chunk-copied and hashed into a private mode-`0700`
  runner staging directory within its declared plain archive extent. The
  runner maps those authenticated files read-only and decodes the potentially
  large root
  arrays one canonical record at a time instead of buffering the archive or
  whole survey documents. The runner
  independently enforces the complete typed Rust survey schemas, retention and
  evidence accounting with the fixed 5,000-record and 64-MiB limits, fixed
  profile ecosystem plus `conary-sat` projection-2 candidate producer, and
  comparison coverage of the complete zero-failure candidate root set.
  Every retained mismatch root, identity, and candidate outcome must occur in
  that candidate survey. Remi's bounded command outcome supplies the helper's
  per-profile counts, histograms, and comparison candidate-manifest digest, so
  the helper never loads a complete survey document into `jq` merely to build
  the transport manifest. The runner reopens the exact authenticated package
  manifests, reconstructs the strict candidate root stream and manifest while
  streaming candidate outcomes, requires exact root-key and package-identity
  coverage against the authenticated package artifact, and requires that
  digest even when the comparison retains zero mismatches. Nested closure and
  dependency arrays remain streamed, and runner staging holds only the current
  profile's survey files. Package counts and every retained success/failure
  identity are checked before findings can skip comparison. Complete profiles
  are replayed against the authenticated native root stream to recompute the
  comparison counts, histograms, and retained mismatch evidence. The runner
  also requires the deployment, candidate, architecture, and oracle bindings
  to equal its authenticated input record and rejects non-integer aggregate
  count encodings. The helper archives its frozen root-owned survey snapshot
  directly rather than allocating another full staging copy, and materializes
  the authenticated unbounded oracle members in private root-owned staging on
  the `/conary/evidence` capacity domain instead of `/tmp`. On the runner, each
  authenticated artifact ZIP is removed after extraction and each extracted
  lane member is removed after it enters the transport. The workflow has no refresh,
  conversion, proof, promotion, activation, or publication authority.
- Production conversion measurements use the protected
  `remi-conversion-benchmark` workflow. Dispatch names one successful
  `deploy-remi-candidate` run, a public profile, an immutable package key, and
  an exact registered profile revision, and the exact size and SHA-256 of a
  credential-free HTTPS source artifact. The workflow derives the deployed
  commit and binary digest from the deployment inspection and candidate
  manifest. The explicit revision digest lets two deployed binaries reopen the
  same retained immutable authority even when a later refresh changes the
  current candidate; Remi rejects an unregistered or mismatched revision before
  conversion. Source bytes are downloaded and authenticated on the hosted
  runner, transferred to one derived `/tmp` name, and never retained as an
  Actions artifact. The production environment supplies the private key and an
  exact `REMI_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` pin; the workflow rejects an entry that does not
  bind the selected production host and never performs live host-key discovery.
- The workflow installs the helper from its already-merged workflow authority
  and calls only `benchmark-remi-conversion` with typed identities. The helper
  reauthenticates the installed binary, configuration, and source bytes,
  requires the live and isolated benchmark roots to be distinct directories on
  the same XFS carrier, makes private trusted configuration and source copies
  on that carrier, and runs exactly two pinned-revision iterations as `conary`.
  `/work/remi-conversion-benchmarks` is the fixed plain mode-0700
  `conary:conary` parent on XFS and outside `/conary`. When it is absent, the
  helper creates it only after proving `/work` is plain and on the same XFS
  carrier as `/conary`; when it
  exists, the helper validates rather than repairs its ownership, mode, type,
  location, and filesystem. It requires the service to be active before the
  operation, stops it only after every preflight succeeds, and has trap-backed
  restart and liveness recovery on success, benchmark failure, or signal.
  Every retained benchmark-state mutation stays under a new
  `/work/remi-conversion-benchmarks/<run-id>` root outside `/conary`; repeated
  identities and preexisting transports fail closed.
- The complete schema-v8 report remains mode 0600 on the production host. The
  authenticated caller receives only `conversion-benchmark-public-v6.json`: a
  strict Rust-produced projection that binds the raw-report byte count
  and SHA-256, preserves authority, timing, process, VFS, work, and output
  counters, and removes binary paths, root paths and device IDs, free-form
  failure text, and skipped-phase explanations. The workflow independently
  binds that projection to the deployment and dispatch identities, requires one
  successful cold and one hot repetition with equal proof digests and
  byte/count geometry, and preserves each repetition's independently measured
  reopen and complete-hash duration. Every reported root must prove XFS. The
  generic RPM predicate additionally requires exact one-pass decode/spool
  geometry: spooled bytes equal declared bytes, payload spool reopens and
  reread bytes are zero, and cryptographic hash input is exactly one or two
  times spooled bytes according to the declared RPM file-digest algorithm.
  The conversion-core predicate additionally requires one source open per
  regular content owner, zero payload-source reopens/reread bytes, aggregate
  payload crypto input equal to chunk-identity plus whole-content SHA-256
  input, one write per unique signed object, deduplicated bytes, and zero
  staging canonical rereads or durability calls. Schema v8 additionally
  requires canonical fixed-block encode/decode geometry and the exact checked
  buffering ceilings for the reported worker allocations.
  This predicate applies to the dispatched RPM subject rather than naming a
  fixed package. The workflow retains the public projection, source-byte
  verification, candidate
  manifest, and deployment inspection for 30 days. It never uploads the raw
  report, source bytes, source URL, SSH material, or host-local paths.
- A failed production benchmark emits exactly one helper-owned schema-v1
  envelope containing only an allowlisted stage, bounded exit status, and
  service-restoration outcome. The workflow validates that envelope, binds it
  to the exact deployment, workflow, binary, profile, revision, package, and
  source identities, and may retain only that path-free JSON record. The
  `/work` preflight uses path-free leaves: `work-root-type` requires a
  plain directory; `work-root-owner` requires the control identity;
  `work-root-mode` rejects group- or world-writable access;
  `work-root-resolution` covers canonical resolution; `work-root-separation`
  covers non-overlap and non-aliasing with the live Remi root;
  `work-root-filesystem` requires XFS; and `work-root-device` requires the same
  filesystem device as the live root. None retains the observed path,
  identity, mode, filesystem value, or device identifier. The
  helper writes the envelope on an isolated stdout channel while all free-form
  diagnostics remain on private stderr. Missing, duplicate, malformed, or
  unknown envelopes fail closed with an unproven service outcome. Private
  stderr, its digest and size, and any free-form Remi failure text are deleted
  without entering Actions logs or artifacts.
- The temporary owner-repair and retirement workflows, their policy checks,
  and their tests are removed. No
  dispatchable owner-repair or retirement surface remains. Future owner drift
  is a fail-closed `work-root-owner` benchmark failure and requires a new
  issue-backed, reviewed operation.
- Production R2 inventory and backfill use the manually dispatched
  `remi-r2-durability` workflow after its exact `commit_sha` is merged into
  `main` and deployed. The protected job enters through the normal Remi SSH
  boundary and calls the typed operation on the loopback-only admin listener;
  it does not copy an admin bearer token off the host. The workflow shares the
  non-cancelling `deploy-and-verify` concurrency group, so neither its read nor
  mutation phase can overlap a deployment or a stopped-service benchmark.
  `plan` is read-only. `apply` fails unless a fresh post-upload R2 listing proves
  complete, and the retained artifact is aggregate `public-sanitized` evidence
  with diagnostic samples removed.
- After completeness is established, `[r2].enabled = true` is the single
  authority switch: startup requires usable R2 configuration, public chunk
  reads use presigned redirects, and local chunks are an R2-verified LRU cache
  bounded by `storage.max_cache_size`. Missing durable objects fail closed;
  operators do not restore retired redirect, write-through, threshold, or age
  flags.
- Conary release artifact publication through the same helper verifies the
  CI-produced `SHA256SUMS` file from the staging directory before installing
  files into `/conary/releases/<version>`. The helper copies that verified
  checksum file as release evidence, refuses symlinked trust inputs, and
  requires `<artifact>.ccs.sig` whenever a staged `.ccs` artifact is present.
- Large QEMU fixtures use the helper's bounded
  `publish-test-artifact <filename> <sha256> <staged-file>` operation after
  authenticated SSH staging under `/tmp`. It accepts only a plain basename and
  regular file, enforces Remi's 8 GiB limit, verifies the caller-pinned digest
  before publication, and creates an immutable `/conary/test-artifacts/`
  target atomically. Repeating the publication is idempotent; a
  same-name, different-digest replacement fails closed.
- Bootstrap or repair deploy access once from an existing privileged shell with
  `sudo scripts/install-remi-deploy-access.sh`. It installs
  `deploy/remi-deploy-helper.sh` to `/usr/local/sbin/conary-remi-deploy`,
  installs `deploy/sudoers/remi` to `/etc/sudoers.d/remi`, and validates the
  sudoers file with `visudo -cf`.
- After bootstrap, `ssh <admin>@ssh.conary.io 'sudo -n /usr/local/sbin/conary-remi-deploy verify-access'`
  should succeed without prompting for a password. This operation verifies
  root execution and the installed Remi configuration only; it deliberately
  works before the first Remi binary or service start so a clean host does not
  have a circular bootstrap dependency.
- `scripts/rebuild-remi.sh` is retired for production deploys. It now fails
  closed and points operators back to the GitHub release/deploy flow and the
  root-owned helper.
- Host-local credential files such as ignored `deploy/.credentials.toml` <!-- repo-path: local --> are not
  canonical deployment instructions; tracked operations docs and deploy helpers
  are the source of truth.
- The public frontends currently share the Remi host but deploy as two separate
  static sites. `deploy/deploy-sites.sh` builds locally, stages the build output
  under `/tmp` on `<admin>@ssh.conary.io`, then asks
  `/usr/local/sbin/conary-remi-deploy deploy-site` to publish it into
  `/conary/site/` for `conary.io` or `/conary/web/` for `remi.conary.io`.
- Post-release public-frontend updates deploy from the selected `main` commit
  selected by the manually dispatched `deploy-site` workflow. Its required
  `target` choice publishes `site`, `packages`, or `both` through the
  repository-held production key. The workflow runs the relevant frontend
  checks, verifies the selected public home content and Remi API when
  applicable, and always verifies the branded status-aware 404 after a main
  site deployment. It shares the non-cancelling `deploy-and-verify` concurrency
  group so publication and its Remi probes cannot overlap any other production
  host transition or stopped-service benchmark.

#### Direct static-site deployment

The protected `deploy-site` workflow is the normal deployment path. Authorized
operators may run `deploy/deploy-sites.sh` directly for recovery or debugging,
but the script deliberately refuses a bare invocation. Record the real admin
login, private-key path, and pinned `known_hosts` entry in the ignored
`docs/operations/LOCAL_ACCESS.md`. <!-- repo-path: local --> Create a dedicated SSH
configuration from those values; never discover the live key during deployment:

```bash
identity_file=/absolute/path/to/production_identity
known_hosts_file=/absolute/path/to/production_known_hosts
ssh_config_file="$(mktemp)"

# Populate known_hosts_file only from the reviewed pin in LOCAL_ACCESS.md.
test -s "$known_hosts_file"
chmod 600 "$known_hosts_file"
cat >"$ssh_config_file" <<EOF
Host ssh.conary.io
  UserKnownHostsFile $known_hosts_file
  GlobalKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  IdentityFile $identity_file
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  BatchMode yes
  StrictHostKeyChecking yes
EOF
chmod 600 "$ssh_config_file"
ssh-keygen -F ssh.conary.io -f "$known_hosts_file" >/dev/null

export REMI_HOST='<admin>@ssh.conary.io'
export REMI_SSH_CONFIG="$ssh_config_file"
bash deploy/deploy-sites.sh both  # or: site, packages
```

Delete the temporary SSH configuration after the deployment. `REMI_HOST` names
the login target; `REMI_SSH_CONFIG` is mandatory so every `ssh` and `rsync`
operation uses only the reviewed host-identity pin and ignores global host
files.

- `deploy/configure-site-routing.sh` owns the host-side transition from the old
  SPA fallback to static routing. It requires one unambiguous nginx server for
  `conary.io` rooted at `/conary/site`, backs up the config, changes missing
  paths to `=404` with `/404.html` as the error body, validates nginx, and
  restores the backup if validation or reload fails.
- The package frontend is the one wired into Remi's tracked config via
  `[web].root = "/conary/web"`; the main site remains a separate static root on
  the same host
- The production certificate currently uses Certbot's standalone authenticator,
  so `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/pre/10-nginx-stop` must stop nginx before
  an attempted renewal and
  `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/post/90-nginx-start` must start it afterward,
  including after a failed attempt. Validate this host-local contract with
  `sudo certbot renew --dry-run --cert-name remi.conary.io --non-interactive --no-random-sleep-on-renew`;
  the 2026-07-16 production repair passed that simulation and restored public
  health for all three certificate names.

## Release Flow

- GitHub Actions is the only long-term CI/CD control plane.
- The eight Cargo packages are code-ownership boundaries. The four artifact
  products are Conary, Remi, conaryd, and conary-test. One suite release owns
  their shared root `[workspace.package]` version, reviewed commit, tag, and
  GitHub release. All members inherit `publish = false`; there is no parallel
  crates.io release track.
- Run `./scripts/release.sh suite --dry-run` to inspect the next version, or
  pass a version decision as `--target MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The target must be an
  increasing `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version for the complete suite.
- Run `./scripts/release.sh suite --prepare-only --target VERSION` on the
  issue-linked release branch. Preparation updates the root version, inherited
  workspace lock state, Conary native/CCS packaging, generated man page, and
  suite changelog, but creates no commit or tag.
- After head-bound CI and review complete, merge the preparation PR and prove
  local `main`, `origin/main`, and remote `main` agree. Only then create the
  annotated `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag at that reviewed commit and push it. The
  active `Protect suite tags` ruleset permits creation of `v*` tags but rejects
  their update or deletion. Live release construction rejects a tag commit
  that is not reachable from `origin/main` and revalidates the remote tag
  immediately before draft mutation and publication.
- A protected tag whose release construction fails remains reserved evidence;
  correct the cause in an issue-linked reviewed commit, prepare a strictly
  higher suite version, and create a new tag. Never move or reuse the failed
  tag.
- Product-prefixed tags remain immutable historical evidence for their
  trees. They are not current baselines, version inputs, or workflow routes.
- `release-build` constructs all four products from the exact suite tag,
  serializes their deployment modes in one schema-v1 metadata document with a
  typed rehearsal boolean, verifies raw and tar identities plus binary
  versions, generates one complete checksum set, and publishes one GitHub
  release only after every product bundle succeeds. Repository release
  immutability is enabled, so publishing the completed draft locks its tag and
  assets and creates a GitHub release attestation. Released-artifact proof must
  reject any draft or mutable release; closeout independently runs
  `gh release verify` and `gh release verify-asset`.
- Conary's release bundle also owns `conary-bootstrap-v1.manifest` and its
  detached signature. The manifest binds the canonical tag/version plus exact
  Fedora 44 RPM, Ubuntu 26.04 DEB, and Arch x86_64 package basenames, sizes,
  and SHA-256 values. The public `/install-conary-preview.sh` endpoint embeds
  the matching release public key, verifies signed authority before host
  selection, defaults to preview, and requires `--apply --yes` for the native
  package transaction. The exact-tag released-artifact workflow proves that
  path inside a clean container for every supported host.
- `merge-validation` proves the current source tree through deterministic
  source, build, policy, and test checks. It must not probe mutable production
  endpoints, because production continues to serve the previously deployed
  release until the candidate passes this gate and is tagged. Compatible GNU
  jobs may reuse compiler outputs through one exact-policy namespace derived
  from the toolchain, lockfile, target, native ABI, and codegen settings. Each
  workflow has one writable primer that bulk-saves a bounded local compiler
  cache under the exact commit. Consumers fail on a missing seed, restore that
  exact cache read-only, run their complete commands, and retain typed hit,
  miss, write, and error evidence. The cache is optimization, never test or
  artifact authority. GitHub scopes pull-request writes to that pull request's
  merge ref, so trusted `merge-validation` also publishes GNU and native-matrix
  snapshots from reviewed `main`. Later pull requests may read those
  default-branch snapshots but cannot overwrite them; content-keyed compiler
  objects miss only when their compilation inputs change. When a pull request
  closes, `cleanup-pr-caches` enumerates and deletes only that
  `refs/pull/<number>/merge` cache scope. Those snapshots cannot serve sibling
  pull requests; removing them protects the bounded repository cache quota and
  the reusable default-branch seeds without touching any other ref.
  The protected native-matrix producer applies the same bulk-transfer model to
  its distinct musl target and static dependency policy: it restores one prior
  seed, compiles locally, stops sccache, and saves the new exact-head seed once.
  Once independently verified, the packaged static bundle is cached under the
  exact workflow run and commit so a retry can verify and reopen it before
  skipping setup and relinking. This reuse never crosses runs or source heads.
  Workspace tests fan out by Conary, conary-core library, conary-core binary
  and integration targets, and remaining workspace ownership, then converge on the stable
  fail-closed `workspace-tests` check.
- `deploy-and-verify` consumes that serialized metadata instead of re-deriving
  product behavior locally. It deploys and proves Remi first, then stages and
  proves Conary release assets and static sites from the same suite bundle.
- Within GitHub Actions, `deploy-and-verify` owns live contract proof after it
  deploys the exact tagged artifact. For Remi this includes both liveness and
  structured fail-closed readiness; independent production verification still
  follows the terminal workflow result.
- conaryd and conary-test are first-class suite artifacts with explicit
  `deploy_mode=none`; no runtime deployment job may start for either product.
- Native builders explicitly disable distro-default debug split packages
  because the suite defines no debug artifact product. Upload and bundle steps
  do not filter unexpected native outputs; an extra package fails exact asset
  validation. The RPM spec also opts out of Fedora's automatic debug-oriented
  Rust flags, manually reapplies the distro's frame-pointer, package-note, and
  native dependency flags, and leaves release codegen and stripping to the
  workspace Cargo profile.
- Every protected `main` push runs `build-remi-candidate` once and retains an
  immutable, exact-commit Remi bundle plus a manifest binding source tree,
  toolchain, build flags, binary and bundle digests, compiler-cache statistics,
  and attributable compiler/phase/link timing for 30 days. The build restores
  one compatible, bounded local-disk sccache snapshot in bulk, compiles without
  per-object network requests, stops the cache server, and saves the completed
  exact-head snapshot once. The signed binary and manifest remain authority;
  cache contents never are. An exact-commit manual rebuild compares
  its binary and bundle byte identities with the protected push artifact.
  `deploy-remi-candidate` remains available between suite releases for bounded
  hard cuts, but it may only locate and verify that successful protected-main
  artifact. It has no Rust setup or compilation path and rejects lookup,
  download, and verification work exceeding 60 seconds. The deployment creates
  no tag or release and does not change suite version authority.
- Release verification is a GitHub workflow concern, not a Forgejo or
  Forge-hosted control-plane concern

## Contributor Notes

- Prefer the tracked docs for stable roles and workflows, and keep local-only
  access details in `docs/operations/LOCAL_ACCESS.md`, <!-- repo-path: local --> using
  [`docs/operations/LOCAL_ACCESS.example.md`](LOCAL_ACCESS.example.md) as the
  starting template
- For suite layout, phase selection, and manifest-run behavior, use
  [`docs/INTEGRATION-TESTING.md`](../INTEGRATION-TESTING.md)
- For conary-test validation, use `cargo run -p conary-test -- list` and the
  focused `run` commands in `docs/INTEGRATION-TESTING.md`.
- For assistant and contributor routing, use `AGENTS.md` and
  [`docs/llms/README.md`](../llms/README.md); Git history remains available for
